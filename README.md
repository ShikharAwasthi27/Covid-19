Analyzing the novel coronavirus dataset for India.

Dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/india?country=IND~

Problem Statement: The dataset contains the information about all countries till 26/5/2020. We want to make a forecast of the number of new cases in the coming month.

Approach: Gleaning the data specific to India and then making some basic visualizations explaining the current status of novel coronavirus
in India, including day-wise number of new cases, testing and deaths reported. The data provided has been used to train an SARIMAX model to 
forecast the number of new cases in the coming month given that the rate of testing keeps increasing at the same rate.
